For each new strategy, create a separate folder within this directory where all backtesting and development code will be stored. Within each strategy directory create two sub-directories:
Development: This subdirectory should include all mathematical logic and data pre-processing. There should be a file titled run.py which once run, returns trading signals
Backtesting: This subdirectory should use the signals returned from run.py in the development directory to generate backtesting results.
